# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)

**Core value:** A Telegram user can start an OpenCode session, send messages, and receive properly formatted streaming responses — as if they were using OpenCode directly.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: grammY chosen over Telegraf (TypeScript-first, active maintenance)
- [Init]: marked + sanitize-html for markdown→HTML (not telegramify-markdown)
- [Init]: Single shared SSE connection to `GET /event`, filter by sessionID
- [Init]: Stream plain text during response, apply HTML formatting on final message only
- [Phase 01-foundation]: parseEnv() extracted to parse-env.ts separate from env.ts singleton — enables test imports without triggering process.exit(1)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: ESM project with type=module and NodeNext — all imports use .js extensions even for TypeScript source

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- OpenCode `question.asked` / `permission.asked` event schema needs validation against live payloads (Phase 5 risk)
- `sendMessageDraft` (Bot API 9.3+) adoption vs `editMessageText` — verify grammY support before Phase 2
