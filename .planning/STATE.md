## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: grammY chosen over Telegraf (TypeScript-first, active maintenance)
- [Init]: marked + sanitize-html for markdown→HTML (not telegramify-markdown)
- [Init]: Single shared SSE connection to `GET /event`, filter by sessionID
- [Init]: Stream plain text during response, apply HTML formatting on final message only

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- OpenCode `question.asked` / `permission.asked` event schema needs validation against live payloads (Phase 5 risk)
- `sendMessageDraft` (Bot API 9.3+) adoption vs `editMessageText` — verify grammY support before Phase 2
